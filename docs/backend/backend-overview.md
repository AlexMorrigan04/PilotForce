# Backend System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines the backend architecture for the PilotForce application, which will utilize various AWS services to support the React frontend.

## Architecture Overview

![Backend Architecture](../assets/backend-architecture-diagram.png)

The backend system will be built using the following AWS services:

1. **API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for API requests from the frontend
2. **AWS Lambda**: Handles business logic in serverless functions
3. **DynamoDB**: Primary database for storing application data
4. **S3**: Storage for static assets and user uploads (images, files)
5. **Cognito**: User authentication and authorization
6. **CloudFront**: Content delivery for optimized frontend performance

## System Flow

1. **Client Request**: The React application sends HTTP requests to API endpoints
2. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate Lambda functions
3. **Lambda Functions**: Execute business logic, communicate with DynamoDB and other services
4. **Response**: Data is returned to the client via API Gateway

## Data Storage Strategy

- **User data**: Stored in DynamoDB tables with appropriate access patterns
- **Media/Assets**: Stored in S3 buckets with appropriate permissions
- **Authentication**: Managed through Cognito User Pools

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication with Cognito
- Fine-grained IAM permissions for Lambda functions
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation at API Gateway and Lambda levels

## Recommended Implementation Path

1. Set up AWS resources (detailed in aws-resources-setup.md)
2. Implement authentication (detailed in authentication-setup.md)
3. Create Lambda functions for core business logic (detailed in lambda-implementation.md)
4. Design and implement DynamoDB tables (detailed in dynamodb-setup.md)
5. Configure S3 for file storage (detailed in s3-setup.md)
6. Connect frontend to backend (detailed in frontend-integration.md)

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Scalability**: Serverless architecture automatically scales to handle varying loads
2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay only for what you use with no idle resources
3. **Security**: Comprehensive security controls at each layer
4. **Reliability**: High availability through AWS's global infrastructure
5. **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns with modular services
6. **Development Speed**: Rapid development and deployment with managed services

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Cold starts in Lambda | Implement provisioned concurrency for critical functions |
| DynamoDB query limitations | Design tables with access patterns in mind |
| API Gateway throttling | Configure proper limits and implement client-side retry logic |
| Complex authorization rules | Use Cognito groups and custom authorizers |
| Multi-region deployment | Use global tables and multi-region replication if needed |

## Recommended AWS Account Setup

For a clean development environment, we recommend setting up separate AWS accounts for:

1. **Development**: For day-to-day development and testing
2. **Staging**: For pre-production testing
3. **Production**: For the live application

Use AWS Organizations to manage these accounts and implement proper IAM policies.

## Monitoring and Operations

1. Set up CloudWatch dashboards for key metrics
2. Configure alarms for critical thresholds
3. Implement distributed tracing with X-Ray
4. Set up regular backups for DynamoDB
5. Use AWS CloudTrail for auditing
