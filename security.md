## Implemented Security Measures

### HTTP Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by disallowing the page to be embedded in frames

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts loading of resources to trusted sources
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Permissions-Policy**: Controls browser features available to the site

### AWS Security
- IAM roles with minimal permissions
