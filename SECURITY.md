# Security Policy and Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the PilotForce application to ensure data protection, user privacy, and system integrity. Following these guidelines will help maintain a secure application environment.

## Security Fixes Implemented

The following security improvements have been made to address critical vulnerabilities:

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are now sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
2. **Secure Authentication**: Enhanced authentication process with proper token management.
3. **Secure API Communication**: Implemented proper request validation and error handling.
4. **Secure Storage**: Local storage now uses secure patterns to protect sensitive data.
5. **Environment Variable Protection**: Limited exposure of environment variables.
6. **URL Validation**: All URLs are validated to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
7. **Secure File Handling**: Improved file upload/download security with validation.
8. **Error Handling**: Implemented secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information.
9. **CORS Security**: Added proper CORS configuration and validation.
10. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented client-side rate limiting to prevent abuse.
11. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communication now requires HTTPS.
12. **Brute Force Protection**: Added protection against authentication brute force attacks.
13. **Content Security Policy**: Implemented a strict CSP to prevent various attacks.
14. **CSRF Protection**: Added Cross-Site Request Forgery protection with secure tokens.

## Environment Variables Security

### Secure Environment Variables Handling

- Never expose sensitive credentials in client-side code
- Use `REACT_APP_` prefix only for variables that are safe for client exposure
- Store sensitive variables server-side only
- Use the `configUtils.js` module to access environment variables securely

### Sensitive Variables That Should NOT Be Client-Side

- AWS Access Keys and Secret Keys
- API Keys and Secrets
- Authentication Tokens
- Database Credentials
- Encryption Keys

### Environment Variables Security Checklist

- [x] Remove all sensitive credentials from `.env.production`
- [x] Update all URLs to use HTTPS instead of HTTP
- [x] Configure proper CORS settings for cross-origin requests
- [x] Use `configUtils.sanitizeEnvForLogs()` when logging configuration

## Security Best Practices for Development

### Authentication & Authorization

- Always use the `authUtils.js` for authentication operations.
- Never store credentials in code or commit them to the repository.
- Use token-based authentication with proper expiration.
- Validate user permissions for each sensitive operation.
- Implement login attempt limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

### Data Handling

- Use `securityUtils.sanitizeInput()` for all user-provided inputs.
- Store sensitive data using `secureStore` methods with expiration times.
- Never log sensitive information like tokens, passwords, or personal data.
- Use the secure API utilities for all API calls.
- Sanitize all API responses before displaying content.

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints and redirects
- Configure proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Add CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- Validate all URLs before navigation or API calls
- Apply rate limiting to prevent API abuse

### Configuration Management

- Use `configUtils.js` to access environment variables.
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- Use different environment configurations for development and production.
- Run security audit before deployment to catch configuration issues.

### Error Handling

- Use the provided error handling methods that sanitize error details.
- In production, don't expose detailed error messages to users.
- Log errors with appropriate detail level based on environment.

## Security Testing

Before deployment, ensure:

1. Run `npm run security-audit` to check for security configuration issues
2. All inputs are validated and sanitized.
3. Authentication flows work as expected.
4. Authorization checks are in place for protected resources.
5. No sensitive data is exposed in logs or API responses.
6. All API endpoints have proper CORS configuration.
7. File uploads have proper validation for type, size, and content.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them immediately via:

1. Email: security@pilotforce.example.com
2. Do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been addressed.

## Regular Security Updates

- Keep all dependencies updated regularly.
- Monitor security advisories for any libraries used in the project.
- Conduct regular security reviews of the codebase.
- Run security audit before each production deployment.
